<!-- This is a paragragh -->
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX School. It aims to teach and learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in C language.

<!-- This is a Heading -->
### Technologies Used:
- C code was written using the Betty style

- C files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
<!-- Make a table to group files in it with there descriptions-->
